 ### Motivation
 
  In an era where computing demands are increasing hence, efficient resource management is crucial to
  ensure better performance and reliability in distributed systems and cloud infrastructures.
  General static load balancing methods generally fail in dynamically changing workloads, 
  leading to inefficiencies. Dynamic load balancing emerges as a crucial solution.

### Problem Statement

This project aims to create a dynamic load balancing system that automatically adjusts on how workloads are shared among servers to prevent any single server from becoming
overwhelmed. The goal is to improve overall system speed and efficiency, especially when the number
of tasks change.

### Features

• The clock is used to synchronize the operations of all components. This guarantees that no two
tasks are allocated at the same time, preventing conflicts or misallocations. It displays the time
for the request to get accepted by server.

• LEDs are incorporated to provide real-time visual feedback of the system’s operation.

• If a server’s counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the system initiates load rebalancing.Which
reassigns the request to different server.

• Dynamic load balancing systems can prioritize certain tasks over others based on predefined
criteria such as urgency, resource intensity or deadline.

• Dynamic load balancing can reduce the overall power consumption of a system.
